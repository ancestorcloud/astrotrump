  'You are more closely related to Trump than 80% of the human race. Did you know, he is just as concerned about family relationships as you? Donald Trump was an active member of the “birther” movement, a popular conspiracy theory that came about during Obama’s 2008 election. He conducted an investigation in Hawaii to backup his accusations. In 2014, when Obama released his information publicly, Trump referred to it as his “so-called birth certificate, or whatever it was.” Looks like that family curiosity is in your DNA.',
  'No wonder your hair looks like that sometimes! Although when The Donald wakes up in the morning his locks look quite differently. His remarkable hairstyle is achieved after blow-drying his hair forward and then combing it backward. At this time we can not divulge the secrets of how he maintains his many shades of curiously unclear hair. Although your roots may have their bad days, your genetic roots will forever have a claim to american fame.',
  'Trump has said, “I’m the number 1 developer in New York, I’m the biggest in Atlantic City, and maybe we’ll keep it that way.” We’d suggest you stay close to Trump as this mogul expands his empire throughout the world. We all love having family members whose net worth is $4.5 billion. (Well according to Forbes it’s 4.5 billion... according to Trump it’s over 10 billion.) So there ya go! Proof of that rich uncle you’ve always wanted to be related to.',
  'The great thing about family is we can always learn from their mistakes! We wouldn’t exactly call him a “family guy”. His first marriage was 1977 to Czech model Ivana Zelnickova (an alternate to the Czech Olympic Ski Team) and cheated on her with second marriage, actress Marla Maples in 1993. Trump divorced Maples in 1999 and married his current wife and Slovenian model Melania Knauss, in 2005. He also said on camera, “If Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.” We hope The Donald Complex doesn’t run in your family!!',
  'We bet you get your healthy habits from your cousin too! Although this may come as a surprise to you Trump has never smoked a cigarette, drank alcohol or done drugs. He of course has however, his own brand of vodka. Launched in 2006, he self described it as a “superb product and beautifully packaged”. Sadly consumers didn’t agree and the vodka line ended abruptly in 2011 due to slow sales. So next time you’re tempted to monetize the misfortune of others, keep in mind what it did to the reputation of your distant cousin.',
  'Did you know it’s in your blood to be a tough cookie? Ever aspired to attend a great college? Both could be in your cards given Donald is your distant cousin. From being shipped off to a military boarding school by his parents at a young age, to getting into the most prestigious business schools in the country, there is no doubt your cousin Trump aspires to learn. You never know, maybe having his name in your family tree will help you get accepted into the school of your dreams.',
  'Ever wonder where you or a sibling of yours got that germaphobe nature from? That could have been from Donald Trump! Your distant cousin is a self-confessed germaphobe, which stems from a common obsessive-compulsive disorder. He does not like to shake hands, or touch people at all. He doesn’t even like to push the ground floor level button on an elevator because so many foreign people have touched it before. Next time you take an extra squirt of hand-sanitizer remember you’re not the only freak out there, it probably runs in the family!',
  'Now I know what you’re thinking… he was the last person you were going to vote for and now you’re learning that you’re distant cousins! It can’t be all that bad, at least in his words: “I’m the worst thing that’s ever happened to ISIS.” So rest assured that ISIS doesn’t like him even if you’re not so proud of this new revelation in your family tree.',
  'We’re sorry if this isn’t good news for you. If you it makes you feel any better, Hillary Clinton is Donald’s 19th cousins, and they are learning to get along just great! Well, not really but hey, this just proves that we don’t always get along or agree with our family members!',
  'You’ve finally found your claim to fame! Donald Trump received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2007 for his TV show, The Apprentice. We hope that this cousin of yours inspires some desire in you to reach the stardom you’ve always dreamed of. Whether you’re an aspiring actor/actress or a Real Estate Mogul this really goes to show that anyone can make it to the Hollywood Walk of Fame! So don’t give up on your dreams and don’t be afraid to call up Donald Trump for any advice, after all, he is your cousin!!',
  'You likely get your “Can Do” attitude from your cousin Donald Trump! We all think of him as this force to be reckoned with, and he certainly sees himself as unstoppable.  Next time your bank account hits zero, just remember Trump has been there before, 4 times! You can’t quit yet, you keep trying, maybe someday you’ll even feel inspired to run for President of the United States. Why not?',
  'Maybe that’s why you’ve always been so focused on your good grades! That must run in your family DNA! After Trump attended the New York Military Academy, he went on to higher education at Fordham University and later University of Pennsylvania receiving his BA in economics. He told CNN the Wharton School of Finance is the hardest school to get into, “it’s like super genius stuff”. Good for you, for keeping on with that degree, your intelligence and perseverance is something you’ve likely inherited from a common ancestor 28 generations back!!',
  'Well look at that! He is a cousin afterall!! He may not be the best family guy, but that doesn’t stop him from monetizing family game night! Though this likely won’t come as a surprise, Donald Trump is the only presidential candidate with his very own board game! Hitting stores in 1989, “Trump: The Game” is modeled similarly to Monopoly, using Trump cards to buy and sell properties. If this game doesn’t bring your family closer, we don’t know what will. Just $13.99 on ebay!',
  'Trump is your cousin, and he’s a sports lover too!! Most of us stopped playing sports in high school, but why stop playing when you can just purchase an entire football team? In 1983 Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals. At one time he was even a financial advisor for Mike Tyson. Bet you never thought your distant cousin was such a sports fanatic, it must run in the family!',
  'Well there you go! You really are cousins with a billionaire. Whether this is good news to you or bad, it may help explain your indecisive nature. Trump has had various political positions often contradicting himself. It appears as if he doesn’t always know quite where he stands on an issue. As pertaining to Iowa for example in January 2016 he said, “I love Iowa, we’ve done really well here.” In November 2015, “How stupid are the people of Iowa”. Whether you are for Trump or against Trump...or you really can’t decide -- you share a common ancestor, making it all relative.',
  'Maybe you’ve always loved TV reality shows/ contests. Well your cousin Donald does too! We’re all-too familiar with The Apprentice but are you familiar with his ties to the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants? Unfortunately after a nasty comment made about Mexican immigrants, NBC and Univision ended their business relationship with Trump - to which he responded with a $500 million lawsuit, and then won.'
